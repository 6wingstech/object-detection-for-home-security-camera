# object-detection-for-home-security-camera
Add object detection to home security camera

This is a script to add object detection/security to any home camera. It uses object detection from tensorflow to detect and identify objects when they come into vision. When objects are found, it will save images every 2 frames on the local computer, and automatically send the owner a message via slack to notify who or what is in view of wherever the camera is placed. Made for use with fixed-location cameras.
